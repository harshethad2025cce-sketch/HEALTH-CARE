            The improvement or maintenance of health involves prevention, diagnosis, treatment,
            and cure of disease, illness, and impairments. Healthcare emphasizes a holistic
            approach—addressing physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects of
            well-being. It includes public and private health sectors, healthcare providers,
            and insurance systems working together to maintain quality, access, and efficiency.

            Patient-centered care focuses on respecting patient preferences. Maintaining
            high standards for quality and cost-effectiveness ensures a balanced healthcare
            system that benefits individuals and communities.
